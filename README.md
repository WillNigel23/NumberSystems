## Task

You are to create a GUI-based Java program, that would accept two numbers, of the same or 
different bases, and output the sum and product in binary, decimal, and hexadecimal. You are 
also to submit the Javadoc associated with the project. 

## Procedure

Given two numbers and their respective bases (binary, decimal, or hexadecimal), you are to add 
and multiply the numbers. Display the result in binary (in multiples of 8 binary digits), decimal, 
and hexadecimal (in multiples of 4 hexadecimal digits), regardless of the bases of the two 
numbers. You are also to include a Javadoc that would explain the methods and fields used in 
your program.

## Example

Input:
> 15A0 base 16 

> 10100100 base 2 

Output: 
> Sum is 00010110 01000100 base 2, 5700 base 10, 1644 base 16 

> Product is 0001101 11011010 10000000 base 2, 907904 base 10, 000D DA80 base 16
